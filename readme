## testing function call on heap
Now the test is for the whole object file, it's not needed to copy it's text section to another file.The related points as such:
* Giving the execution access to heap
* Copying the object file to heap
* Finding the .text address and functions' address in the file, it refers to the section headers as .text, .symtab, strtab, shstrtab.
* Combining the base address to locate the function, then call the function.   

If you need to test without considering the location of the code,  copying the contents of the .text to a new file, follow the command:

```
objcopy -dump-section .text=com.bin com.o

```
